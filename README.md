# The-Wall
# How long would The Wall stand under it's own weight? Observations of glaciers show that ice flows down slope. Ice deforms under through a combination of elastic and plastic deformation. This project is an attempt to model the time it takes The Wall to deform from its described height towards a final height.

# The Wall is described as being partially constructed using magic. Here it is assumed that the magic has allowed The Wall to maintain its present height and resist deformation. This model will describe a scenario through which the magic is removed or destroyed, thus allowing deformation of ice to continue naturally.

# I attempted to code this scenario a few years ago, without success. Now that the final season of HBO's Game of Thrones is on, I request assistance in solving, what I think is a fun question. 

# Tim Sherry - Recent research results have returned from the wall, it appears that some the ice used in constcution was ICE 9 (Vonnegut, 1963). This may offset and affect the strength of the ice in the wall, studies into the strength of ICE 9 are on-going. Also, there is no code on your master branch?
